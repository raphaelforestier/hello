        <h1 style="color:#010101;">Dropbox Quick Start</h1>
        <h3>What is Dropbox ?</h3>
        <p>Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and videos anywhere. Any file
        you save to your Dropbox will also automatically save to all your computers, phones, and even
        the Dropbox website. This means that you can start working on your computer at school or the 
        office, and finish on your home computer. Never email yourself a file again!</p>

        <h3>The Dropbox Folder</h3>

        <p>After you install Dropbox on your computer, a Dropbox folder is created. If you’re reading this
        guide, then that means you had no problems finding your Dropbox folder :). This folder is just
        like any other folder on your computer, but with a twist. Any file you save to your Dropbox
        folder is also saved to all your other computers, phones, and the Dropbox website.</p>

        <p>On top of your Dropbox is a green icon that lets you know how your Dropbox is doing:</p>




        <!-- add two pictures on the left of green and blue -->
        <img src="img/ok.jpg" alt="ok" width=75 height=61 class="flotteok" />
        <p><p style="line-height:65px;"><strong>Green circle and check:</strong> All the files in your Dropbox are up to date.</p>
        <img src="img/circleblue.jpg" alt="circleblue" width="70" height=61 class="flottecircleblue" />
        <p><p style="line-height:61px;"><strong>Blue circle and arrows:</strong> Files in your Dropbox are currently being updated.</p>


        <!-- step and add for every step a picture on the right -->

        <h3>Adding files to your Dropbox</h3>
        
        <ul> 
          
          <p><li><img src="img/stepone.jpg"alt="step1" width="224" height="234" class="step1" /><p><p style="line-height:234px;"><strong>Step 1</strong>  Drag and drop a file into your Dropbox folder.</p></li> 
          <li><img src="img/steptwo.jpg" alt="step1" width="224" height="234"class="step2" /><p><p style="line-height:234px;"><strong>Step 2</strong> The blue icon means your file’s syncing with Dropbox.</p></li>
        
        </ul>

  
        <ul>
       
      
        <p><img src="img/thatit.jpg"alt="thatit" width="224" height="234" class="thatit" />
        That’s it! The green icon means that your ﬁle has finished
        saving to your other computers and the Dropbox website.
        Now that your file’s in Dropbox, any changes made to it will
        be automatically detected and updated to your other
        computers.</p>
           
            
        </ul>
    
    

         <h3><p class="resolve"/>The Dropbox Right-click/Context Menu</p></h3>
       
        <p>When you Right-Click (Windows/Linux) or Control-Click (Mac) a ﬁle or folder in your Dropbox,
        you’ll see a menu that lets you do a few neat things with Dropbox:</p>

        <ul>

          <li> <strong>Share a Folder</strong> Invite your friends, family and teammates to a folder in your Dropbox. It’ll be
          as if you saved that folder straight to their computers.</li>
          <li><strong>View Previous Versions</strong> View a record of changes made to a file. You can choose to go back
          to an earlier version of a file if you’d like.</li>
          <li><strong>Browse on Dropbox Website...</strong> View a ﬁle on the Dropbox website.</li>
          <li><strong>Copy Public Link</strong> Generate a link to any file in your Public Folder. You can then send this link
          to anyone you’d like to view that file.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>The Dropbox Tray/Menu bar icon</h3>

        <p>The Dropbox tray or menu bar icon is located on the bottom (Windows) or top (Mac/Linux) of
        your screen, and lets you check the status and settings of your Dropbox. The same green, blue,
        and red icons that appear on the fi les and folders in your Dropbox also appear over this icon to
        let you know the status of your Dropbox.</p>

        

        <p>Right-clicking this icon gives you a few options:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Open your Dropbox folder, the Dropbox website, or the Dropbox help center.</li>
          <li>See which fi les were recently changed.</li>
          <li>View an estimate of how long it will take Dropbox to finish updating files.</li>
          <li>Change preferences for your connection, Dropbox folder location, and more.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <p><strong>How much does Dropbox cost</strong></p>

        <p>Dropbox is free! If you run out of space, visit https://www.dropbox.com/plans to view our avail
        able subscriptions.</p>


        <p><strong>How much space does my Dropbox have?</strong></p>


        <p>Free accounts come with 2GB of space (deleted files and revisions won’t count against your
        limit). You can always check your usage by visiting your account settings page at https://www.
        dropbox.com/account.</p>


        <p><strong>How long until my files are fully synced?</strong></p>

        <p>Dropbox will download as fast or as slow as your network allows, and will try its best to not hog
        your connection. If you’d like to limit your upload or download rates, you can change them in
        Dropbox’s preferences. For step by step instructions, visit the help article at https://www.drop
        box.com/help/26.</p>

        <p><strong>Dropbox is fast! How could it have possibly synced all of my files in that time?</strong></p>
        
        <p>Dropbox will look to see if it already has the file you’re trying to upload. If it senses that it al
        ready has the file, it won’t bother to upload it again. If the file has been changed recently, it will
        only upload/download the changes rather than the whole thing.</p>


        <p><strong>How secure is Dropbox?</strong></p>

        <p>Dropbox takes the security of your files and of our software very seriously. Dropbox uses Secure 
        Socket Layer (SSL) and AES-256 encryption. AES-256 is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure customer data.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I access Dropbox on my mobile device?</strong></p>

        <p>The Dropbox App is available for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry. To install Dropbox on your mobile device, visit http://www.dropbox.com/anywhere. You can also get to your Dropbox at any time by visiting http://www.dropbox.com from your phone.</p>
